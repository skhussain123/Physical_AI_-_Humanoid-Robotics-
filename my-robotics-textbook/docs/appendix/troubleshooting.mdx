# Troubleshooting

This page provides solutions to common problems you may encounter while working through this textbook.

## ROS 2 Installation Issues

-   **Problem:** `ros2` command not found.
    -   **Solution:** Make sure you have sourced your ROS 2 installation. You should add `source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash` to your `~/.bashrc` file (replace `<distro>` with your ROS 2 distribution, e.g., `humble`).

## Gazebo Issues

-   **Problem:** Gazebo is running very slowly.
    -   **Solution:** Gazebo can be computationally intensive. Make sure you are running it on a computer with a dedicated graphics card. You can also try reducing the `real_time_update_rate` in your world file.
-   **Problem:** My robot model falls through the floor in Gazebo.
    -   **Solution:** This is usually caused by incorrect collision geometry in your URDF/SDF file. Make sure that all the links in your model have a `<collision>` tag with valid geometry.

## Nav2 Issues

-   **Problem:** The robot is not moving when I send a navigation goal.
    -   **Solution:** There are many possible causes for this. Check the following:
        -   Is the Nav2 stack running correctly?
        -   Is the robot localized correctly in the map?
        -   Is there a valid path from the robot's current position to the goal?
        -   Are the costmap parameters configured correctly?

## MoveIt Issues

-   **Problem:** MoveIt is unable to find an IK solution.
    -   **Solution:** This can happen if the desired pose is unreachable or if the IK solver is not configured correctly. Try moving the goal pose to a different location. You can also try a different IK solver.
