## Why Do We Need Robot Models?

Before we can simulate or control a robot, we need a way to describe its physical properties to the software. A robot model defines the robot's structure, including its links, joints, sensors, and visual appearance.

## URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

**URDF** is an XML-based format used in ROS to describe the kinematics and dynamics of a robot. It represents the robot as a tree of **links** connected by **joints**.

-   **Links:** These are the rigid parts of the robot (e.g., the chassis, a wheel, an arm segment).
-   **Joints:** These define the motion between links. Common joint types include `revolute` (for rotating joints), `continuous` (for wheels), and `prismatic` (for sliding joints).

```mermaid
graph TD
    A(base_link) -->|chassis_to_left_wheel_joint| B(left_wheel_link);
    A -->|chassis_to_right_wheel_joint| C(right_wheel_link);
```

## SDF (Simulation Description Format)

**SDF** is another XML-based format, primarily used by the Gazebo simulator. While URDF is great for describing the kinematics of a single robot, SDF is a more comprehensive format that can describe an entire simulation world, including multiple robots, lighting, physics, and sensors.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>When would you choose to use SDF over URDF?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Create a simple URDF file for a robot with a single arm that rotates at the shoulder. Use the `check_urdf` tool to verify your file, and then visualize it in RViz2.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You can now create basic representations of robots for use in ROS and Gazebo.</p>
