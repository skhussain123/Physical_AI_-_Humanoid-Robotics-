# Chapter 1: Sensor Integration in Simulation

This chapter covers the integration of common sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs in a simulation environment.

<Prerequisites>
  <p>You should have a robot model in URDF and be able to spawn it in Gazebo.</p>
</Prerequisites>

<LearningObjective>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand how sensors are simulated in Gazebo.</li>
    <li>Learn how to add a camera, LiDAR, and IMU to a URDF model.</li>
    <li>Be able to visualize sensor data in RViz2.</li>
  </ul>
</LearningObjective>

## Gazebo Sensor Plugins

In Gazebo, sensors are implemented as **plugins**. These plugins generate sensor data based on the state of the simulated world and publish it to ROS 2 topics. To add a sensor to your robot, you need to add a `<sensor>` block to your URDF or SDF file and configure the appropriate plugin.

## Camera

A camera sensor simulates a real-world camera, publishing images to a ROS 2 topic. You can configure the camera's resolution, frame rate, and other parameters. The `gazebo_ros_camera` plugin is commonly used for this.

## LiDAR

A LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor measures distances by emitting laser beams. In Gazebo, a LiDAR sensor plugin simulates this by casting rays into the environment and calculating the distances to objects. The data is typically published as a `sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan` or `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2` message.

## IMU

An IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measures a robot's orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. A Gazebo IMU plugin simulates the readings of a real IMU, often with configurable noise models to make the simulation more realistic.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>What is the role of a Gazebo plugin in sensor simulation?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Add a camera sensor to the front of your simulated robot's chassis. Configure the `gazebo_ros_camera` plugin to publish images to a ROS 2 topic. Use RViz2 to visualize the camera feed.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>Your simulated robot can now "see" the world! This is the first step towards building autonomous robots that can perceive and react to their environment.</p>
