# Chapter 1: Bridging Simulation to Real Hardware (Sim2Real)

This chapter discusses the challenges and techniques for transferring policies and models learned in simulation to real hardware.

<Prerequisites>
  <p>You should have a good understanding of reinforcement learning and how it can be used to train agents in a simulated environment.</p>
</Prerequisites>

<LearningObjective>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the 'reality gap' and why it's a problem.</li>
    <li>Learn about two key techniques for Sim2Real transfer: domain randomization and system identification.</li>
    <li>Be aware of the challenges and limitations of Sim2Real.</li>
  </ul>
</LearningObjective>

## The Reality Gap

Training a robot in simulation is often faster, safer, and cheaper than training on a real robot. However, a policy that works perfectly in simulation may fail completely when deployed on a real robot. This is because no simulator is a perfect model of reality. The differences between the simulation and the real world are known as the **reality gap**.

The reality gap can be caused by many factors, including:

-   Inaccurate physics models (e.g., friction, mass, elasticity).
-   Imperfect sensor models (e.g., noise, biases, lighting conditions).
-   Differences in timing and latency.

## Domain Randomization

**Domain randomization** is a technique that aims to bridge the reality gap by making the simulated environment so varied that the real world looks like just another variation. Instead of training the agent in a single, highly realistic simulation, we train it in a large number of simulations with randomized parameters (e.g., different lighting, textures, friction, mass). This forces the agent to learn a policy that is robust to variations in the environment and is more likely to transfer to the real world.

## System Identification

**System identification** is an alternative approach to Sim2Real. Instead of making the simulation more varied, system identification aims to make the simulation more accurate. It involves running experiments on the real robot to measure its physical properties (e.g., mass, friction, motor constants) and then using these measurements to create a more realistic simulation model.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>What is the main difference in philosophy between domain randomization and system identification?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>If you have access to a physical robot, try to perform a simple system identification experiment. For example, you could measure the friction of the robot's wheels by tilting the surface it's on and measuring the angle at which it starts to slide.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You are now aware of the significant challenges involved in taking a robot from simulation to the real world. You can think critically about how to design training procedures that will lead to robust, transferable policies.</p>
