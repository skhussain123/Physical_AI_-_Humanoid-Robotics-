# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

This capstone project is your opportunity to bring together everything you have learned in this textbook to build a complete autonomous humanoid robot.

<Prerequisites>
  <p>You should have completed all the previous chapters and exercises in this textbook.</p>
</Prerequisites>

<LearningObjective>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply the concepts learned throughout the textbook to a large-scale project.</li>
    <li>Gain experience in system integration and debugging.</li>
    <li>Develop a complete, autonomous robotics application from scratch.</li>
  </ul>
</LearningObjective>

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build and program a simulated humanoid robot that can:

1.  Navigate autonomously in a cluttered indoor environment.
2.  Perceive objects in its environment.
3.  Pick up a specified object.
4.  Place the object at a specified location.

## Project Phases

This project is divided into four phases:

### Phase 1: Robot Design and Simulation

In this phase, you will design the URDF model for your humanoid robot and create a Gazebo world for it to live in. Your robot should have at least two arms with grippers, a head with a camera, and a mobile base.

### Phase 2: Navigation

In this phase, you will integrate the Nav2 stack to give your robot the ability to navigate autonomously. You will need to configure the costmaps, planners, and controllers for a humanoid robot.

### Phase 3: Perception

In this phase, you will add a perception system to your robot. This will involve using a pre-trained object detection model to identify objects in the camera feed.

### Phase 4: Manipulation

In this phase, you will use MoveIt to control the robot's arms. You will write a script that uses the output of your perception system to plan and execute a pick-and-place task.
