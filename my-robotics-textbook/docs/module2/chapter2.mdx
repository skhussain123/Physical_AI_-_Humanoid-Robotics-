## What is Perception?

**Perception** is the process of taking raw sensor data and transforming it into a more meaningful representation of the environment. For example, a perception system might take an image from a camera and identify the location of all the chairs in the image.

## Object Detection

**Object detection** is a computer vision task that involves identifying the presence and location of objects in an image. The output of an object detection algorithm is typically a list of bounding boxes, where each box encloses an object and is associated with a class label (e.g., "person", "car", "chair").

## Semantic Segmentation

**Semantic segmentation** is a more detailed perception task. Instead of just drawing a bounding box around an object, semantic segmentation assigns a class label to every single pixel in the image. This provides a much richer understanding of the scene, as it delineates the exact shape of each object.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>What is the key difference in the output of an object detection algorithm versus a semantic segmentation algorithm?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Find a pre-trained object detection model (such as YOLO or SSD) and a corresponding ROS 2 wrapper. Run the model on the camera feed from your simulated robot and visualize the resulting bounding boxes in RViz2.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You can now give your robot the ability to recognize objects in its environment. This is a crucial step towards building intelligent robots that can interact with the world in a meaningful way.</p>
