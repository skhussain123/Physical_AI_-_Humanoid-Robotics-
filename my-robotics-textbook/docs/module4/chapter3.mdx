## Long-Term Autonomy

Most navigation systems are designed to operate for a short period of time. **Long-term autonomy** is concerned with enabling robots to operate for days, weeks, or even months without human intervention. This introduces a new set of challenges, including:

-   **Life-long mapping:** How can a robot update its map as the environment changes over time?
-   **Localization recovery:** How can a robot recover its position if it gets lost?
-   **Battery management:** How can a robot ensure that it always has enough power to complete its tasks and return to a charging station?

## Multi-Robot Coordination

For tasks that are too large or complex for a single robot, a team of robots can be used. **Multi-robot coordination** is the problem of getting a team of robots to work together effectively. There are two main approaches:

-   **Centralized:** A central server makes all the decisions for the team. This is simple to implement but can be a single point of failure.
-   **Decentralized:** Each robot makes its own decisions based on local information and communication with its neighbors. This is more robust but can be more difficult to design and analyze.

## Exploration

**Exploration** is the task of autonomously exploring an unknown environment to build a map. The goal is to choose a sequence of actions that will reveal the most information about the environment in the least amount of time. This is often framed as a "next-best-view" problem, where the robot must decide where to go next to see the most new territory.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>What is the main advantage of a decentralized approach to multi-robot coordination?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Read about the different exploration algorithms available in the Nav2 stack. Choose one of the algorithms and run it in a simulated environment. Observe how the robot chooses its path to explore the unknown space.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You are now aware of some of the most challenging and interesting research problems in robot navigation. These are the areas where the next generation of robotics breakthroughs will happen.</p>
