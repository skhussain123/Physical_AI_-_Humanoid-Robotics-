# Chapter 4: Robot Operating System Deployment and Maintenance

This chapter covers the deployment and maintenance of ROS-based robot systems.

<Prerequisites>
  <p>You should have a good understanding of ROS 2 and have written your own ROS 2 nodes and packages.</p>
</Prerequisites>

<LearningObjective>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the process of deploying a ROS 2 application.</li>
    <li>Learn how to use launch files to start a complex ROS 2 system.</li>
    <li>Be introduced to tools for debugging and logging in ROS 2.</li>
  </ul>
</LearningObjective>

## From Development to Deployment

So far, you have been running your ROS 2 applications on your development computer. **Deployment** is the process of taking your application and getting it to run on the target robot. This often involves cross-compiling your code for a different architecture (e.g., ARM) and setting up the robot's operating system with the necessary dependencies.

## Launch Files

A complex ROS 2 application can consist of dozens of nodes, each with its own set of parameters. Starting all of these nodes manually would be tedious and error-prone. **Launch files** are Python scripts that allow you to start and configure a complete ROS 2 system with a single command.

With launch files, you can:

-   Start multiple nodes.
-   Set parameters for each node.
-   Remap topic names.
-   Group nodes into namespaces.

## Debugging and Logging

When things go wrong on a real robot, it can be difficult to figure out what happened. ROS 2 provides a number of tools to help with debugging and logging:

-   **`ros2 bag`:** A command-line tool for recording and replaying data from a running ROS 2 system. This is incredibly useful for capturing data from a failed experiment and replaying it in a simulator to debug the problem.
-   **`rqt_console`:** A GUI tool for viewing and filtering log messages from all the nodes in the system.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>What is the purpose of a ROS 2 launch file?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Create a ROS 2 package that contains two nodes: a talker and a listener. Write a launch file that starts both nodes and remaps the topic they use to communicate. Run the launch file and verify that the nodes are communicating correctly.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You now have the skills to take your robotics applications out of the lab and into the real world. You can package, deploy, and maintain your ROS 2 systems on real robots.</p>
