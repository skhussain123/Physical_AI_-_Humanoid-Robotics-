# Chapter 1: Reinforcement Learning for Robotics

This chapter introduces the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics.

## The Reinforcement Learning Framework

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a paradigm of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. The agent takes **actions** in the environment, and the environment returns a **reward** and the next **state**. The agent's goal is to learn a **policy** (a mapping from states to actions) that maximizes the total reward over time.

    subgraph RL Loop
        A(Agent) -- Action --> B(Environment);
        B -- Reward & New State --> A;
    end
```

## Q-Learning

**Q-Learning** is a classic model-free RL algorithm. It learns a **Q-function**, which represents the "quality" of taking a certain action in a certain state. The Q-function is learned by iteratively updating it based on the rewards received from the environment.

## Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

For problems with a large number of states (like robotics), it's not feasible to store a Q-value for every state-action pair. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** solve this problem by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. The neural network takes the state as input and outputs the Q-values for all possible actions.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>In the context of RL, what is a "policy"?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Use the OpenAI Gym library to train a simple RL agent to solve the "CartPole" problem. Experiment with different hyperparameters (like the learning rate and discount factor) and observe how they affect the agent's performance.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You now have a foundational understanding of how reinforcement learning can be used to train intelligent agents. You are ready to explore how these techniques can be applied to more complex robotics problems.</p>
