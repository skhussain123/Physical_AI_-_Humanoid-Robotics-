# Chapter 2: Human-Robot Interaction Fundamentals

This chapter covers the fundamentals of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

<Prerequisites>
  <p>You should have a general understanding of what a robot is and what it can do.</p>

<LearningObjective>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the importance of HRI in the design of modern robots.</li>
    <li>Learn about different modes of human-robot interaction.</li>
    <li>Be introduced to the key safety considerations in HRI.</li>
  </ul>

## What is HRI?

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** is a field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans. As robots move from factory floors into our homes, offices, and hospitals, it is crucial that they are designed to be safe, intuitive, and effective to interact with.

## Modes of Interaction

Humans can interact with robots in many different ways:

-   **Remote Control:** The human directly controls the robot's actions from a distance (teleoperation).
-   **Supervisory Control:** The human provides high-level commands to the robot, and the robot executes them autonomously.
-   **Collaborative Control:** The human and robot work together on a shared task, often in a shared workspace.
-   **Social Interaction:** The robot interacts with humans using social cues, such as speech, gestures, and facial expressions.

## Safety in HRI

Safety is the most important consideration in HRI. When humans and robots share a workspace, there is always a risk of injury. HRI researchers and engineers have developed a variety of techniques to ensure safety, including:

-   **Collision Avoidance:** Using sensors to detect humans and avoid collisions.
-   **Force Limiting:** Designing robots that can only exert a limited amount of force, so they cannot injure a person even if a collision occurs.
-   **Predictive Models:** Using models of human behavior to predict a person's future movements and avoid potential collisions.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>What is the difference between supervisory control and collaborative control?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Think of a task that you do every day that could be made easier with the help of a robot. What mode of interaction would be most appropriate for this task? What are the potential safety concerns?</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You now have an appreciation for the human-centered aspects of robotics. You can think critically about how to design robots that are not only functional but also safe and easy for people to use.</p>
