# Chapter 4: Basic Robot Control

This chapter will cover basic robot control techniques, including teleoperation and simple movements.

<Prerequisites>
  <p>You should have a simulated robot running in Gazebo and be comfortable with basic ROS 2 concepts.</p>
</Prerequisites>

<LearningObjective>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the concept of robot teleoperation.</li>
    <li>Learn how to control a robot using a keyboard or joystick.</li>
    <li>Be able to write a simple ROS 2 node to make a robot move autonomously.</li>
  </ul>
</LearningObjective>

## Teleoperation

**Teleoperation** is the process of controlling a robot from a distance. In ROS 2, this is typically done by running a teleoperation node that reads input from a keyboard, joystick, or other device and publishes velocity commands to a topic.

The standard topic for velocity commands is `/cmd_vel`, and the message type is `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`. A `Twist` message contains two vectors: `linear` (for x, y, z velocity) and `angular` (for roll, pitch, yaw velocity).

## Simple Autonomous Movement

To make a robot move on its own, you can write a ROS 2 node that publishes `Twist` messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic. By controlling the linear and angular velocities over time, you can make the robot follow a specific path.

For example, to make a robot drive in a straight line, you would publish a `Twist` message with a constant positive `linear.x` value and zero for all other values. To make it turn, you would publish a message with a positive or negative `angular.z` value.

<Checkpoint>
  <p>What is the name and message type of the standard ROS 2 topic for robot velocity commands?</p>
</Checkpoint>

<Exercise>
  <p>Write a ROS 2 Python node that makes your simulated robot drive in a circle. You will need to publish a `Twist` message with a constant `linear.x` and a constant `angular.z`.</p>
</Exercise>

<Outcome>
  <p>You can now make a robot move! This is a fundamental skill that you will build upon in the coming chapters.</p>
